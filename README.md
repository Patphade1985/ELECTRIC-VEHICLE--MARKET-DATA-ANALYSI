Question 5: Top 10 Total Vehicles by Model

This analysis, which was intended to be a treemap visualization, has not yet been incorporated into the dashboard. Treemaps are useful for displaying part-to-whole relationships in a hierarchical, space-constrained layout, but a bar chart can serve as an effective alternative if the treemap appears cluttered.
